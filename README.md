# Clicky-Game
This is a memory game where you must remeber what image you clicked on. There are twelve images that will change places when clicked. If you click on the same image more then once, you lose. See if you can get all 12 correct! This app was made using React, Javascript, Express, and uses CSS for styling. It was created by Kevin Cowan as a practice application for using React.
